This was my hobby project. It is just for Learning purpose .I learned a lot about HTML, CSS. As I am from non-coding branch so I need just motivation to learn programming so this was one the hobby project which motivated me to learn 
coding because earlier did coding in C language but didn't get interest because there was no outcome like web-Developement. But by doing this project I felt yes some Intersting 
this appearing on screen. So I got love in Web Developement
